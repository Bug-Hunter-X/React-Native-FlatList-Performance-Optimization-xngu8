In React Native, when using FlatList with a large dataset and complex components, you might encounter performance issues.  One uncommon cause is inefficient key extraction. If the `keyExtractor` function isn't optimized, it can lead to significant re-renders and slowdowns.  Another issue might be improper `ItemSeparatorComponent` usage; unnecessary re-renders of separators can negatively impact performance.  Finally, a lack of virtualization with `initialNumToRender` and `maxToRenderPerBatch` can make the initial render extremely slow for large lists.
